# heatflux

Goal: Reconstruct boundary heat flux from temperature fields using a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN).

## Structure
- `data/` synthetic datasets generated by our forward solver
- `notebooks/` exploration and plots
- `src/` code (forward solver, PINN, training)
- `results/` logs and figures

## Environment
Conda env: `heatflux` (Python 3.10)  
Recreate: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
